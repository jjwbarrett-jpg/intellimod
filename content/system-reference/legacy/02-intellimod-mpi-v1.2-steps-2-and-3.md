## Stage 2: Drafting & Assembling

With our plan in place, we now move into the creative core of the process. This stage is about generating the initial prompt and combining it with the system's core components.

### Step 2: The Draftsman
In this step, we write the initial raw text of our prompt. This is where the main idea or instruction is first put into words.

### Step 3: The Assembler
Here, we bring together the draft with our selected P-Cards and V-Cards. This step structures the prompt and provides the AI with the necessary personality and instructions to execute the task properly.
