### Summary
Serverless functions provide scalable, on-demand execution for backend AI logic, ideal for modular and efficient microservice design.

### Core Principles
   - Serverless functions are event-triggered and managed by the cloud provider.
   - Resources scale automatically to match usage patterns.

### Best Practices
   - Design small, single-purpose functions for different AI tasks (e.g., generation, validation).
   - Use serverless agents for cost-effective orchestration of IntelliMod or SIGS modules.

### Use Cases
   - Hosting logic for tools where multiple AI agents handle tasks like retrieval, formatting, or LLM execution.
