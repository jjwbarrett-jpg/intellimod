### Summary
Git-based CI/CD automates the build, test, and deployment pipeline, triggered by commits to a Git repository.

### Core Principles
   - **Continuous Integration (CI):** Merge developer code after tests pass.
   - **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Release integrated code to production reliably and rapidly.

### Best Practices
   - Connect Netlify or Vercel to GitHub for auto-deploys on push.
   - Implement CI tests to catch bugs before production.

### Use Cases
   - Smoother development cycles
   - Faster feature releases
   - Reduced manual deployment errors
