### Summary
Progressive disclosure is a UX strategy that shows users only the information or options relevant to their current context, reducing overload.

### Core Principles

   - Hide complexity until users signal intent or expertise.

### Best Practices
   - Use collapsible sections, tabs, or hover-over reveals to manage visual load.
   - Apply consistently to avoid disorientation or hiding core features.

### Use Cases
