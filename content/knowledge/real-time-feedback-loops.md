Real time feedback enhances usability and trust by immediately reflecting user input or system state changes.

### Core Principles

   - Use optimistic UI updates to improve perceived performance.

### Best Practices

   - Allow undo or rollback in case optimistic updates fail.

### Use Cases
   - Showing token usage, queue status, or result quality when working with AI tools inside the IntelliMod.
