## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Goal
Generate a spread of unconventional, high-variance ideas that deliberately explore multiple frames and perspectives without fixating on any single path.

### Activation Cues
- "Give me 10 unexpected ways to approach this."
- "What would a child/artist/philosopher suggest here?"
- "Break all the rules — what comes up?"

### Inputs
- **problem_statement**: concise description of the topic or challenge.
- **constraints** (optional): must/should/avoid lists to keep ideas usable.
- **perspective_lenses** (optional): roles, disciplines, or metaphors to sample (e.g., child, philosopher, hacker, biologist).

### Core Technique
- Use **V3_Divergent_Thinking** to widen the search space (vary assumptions, scale, time horizon).
- Apply **V2_Cognitive_Scaffolding** to group ideas into distinct lenses and avoid repetition.
- Optionally add **V5_Visual_Prompting** cues (images/imagery hints) to spark sensory or spatial concepts.
- Favor breadth first (quantity), then annotate seeds worth converging later.

### Output Rules
- Produce a numbered list of high-variance ideas (e.g., 10–20).
- Cluster by lens or theme; keep each idea one to two sentences.
- Mark 2–3 **promising** candidates with a brief why-it-might-work note.
- No execution details beyond a sentence unless asked.

### Example Prompt
**Instruction**: "Brainstorm 12 unconventional approaches. Explore multiple lenses (artist, systems thinker, child). Mark three promising options."
**Input**: `<problem_statement>`

## DEVELOPER NOTES

### Compatible Modes
- Early creative cycle; pre-synthesis exploration.
- Overcoming mental blocks; warming up before structured planning.

### Common Uses
- Breaking out of creative ruts.
- Generating wild, divergent possibilities for products, stories, campaigns.
- Expanding solution space prior to prioritization.

### Sample Modifiers
- "Think outside the box"
- "Unconstrained thinking"
- "Explore unconventional ideas"

### Notes
- Works best early in the cycle; follow with a Refiner/Aligner card to converge.
- Keep at least 30–40% of ideas intentionally weird to avoid local minima.
- If operating in regulated domains, include a quick safety filter pass or a **Negative Prompting** list before sharing.
