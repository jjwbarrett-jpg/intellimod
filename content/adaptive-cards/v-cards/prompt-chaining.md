## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Short Definition
Prompt Chaining is the technique of linking multiple prompts together in a sequence, where each step builds on the previous output. It allows for modular reasoning, intermediate steps, and multi-phase tasks.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary:** Prompt Engineering Techniques
   - **Subdomains:** multi-step workflows, sequential tasks, pipeline construction

### Utility for AI
   - Enables complex task decomposition
   - Supports structured multi-part logic
   - Ideal for tool-assisted chains or automation

### Related Methods
   - Chain-of-Thought
   - Step-by-Step Reasoning
   - Self-Refine

### Use Cases
   - Content planning (e.g., idea → outline → paragraph)
   - Data extraction pipelines
   - Instruction-following workflows

### Prompt Fragment
    Based on the previous output, continue with the next logical step.
