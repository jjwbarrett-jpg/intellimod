## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Short Definition
Vagueness in prompts leads to unclear, ambiguous, or under-specified responses. It prevents the AI from understanding the user's intent clearly and often results in generic or off-target answers.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary:** Pitfalls & Error Handling
   - **Subdomains:** ambiguity, intent fuzziness, under-instruction

### Utility for AI
   - Detects and highlights unclear user input
   - Encourages clarification steps
   - Improves first-response alignment with goals

### Related Methods
   - Instruction Sharpener
   - Clarification Prompts
   - Prompt Diagnostics

### Use Cases
   - Teaching users how to write better prompts
   - Auto-suggesting clarification questions
   - Improving performance in open-ended systems

### Prompt Fragment
    This prompt is too vague. Please specify the format, goal, or domain.
