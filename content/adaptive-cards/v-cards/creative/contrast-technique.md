## TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION
This card forces the AI to break "linear reasoning" by applying specific inversion algorithms. It is useful when the output feels stale or predictable.

## OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS

### 1. THE INVERSION MODES
The system must apply one of the following logic gates to the prompt's subject:

**Mode A: The Reverse (Assumption Inversion)**
* **Algorithm:** Identify the Subject (S) and the Action (A). Invert the relationship.
* **Example:** "Schools teach students" -> "Students teach schools."
* **Goal:** Find value in the opposite direction.

**Mode B: The Paradox (Antagonistic Pairing)**
* **Algorithm:** Take the Core Concept and pair it with its logical enemy.
* **Example:** "Luxury" + "Trash" = "High-End Upcycled Fashion."
* **Goal:** Create tension and novelty.

**Mode C: The Extremes (Constraint Removal)**
* **Algorithm:** Run the scenario twice: once with *Zero Resources* and once with *Infinite Resources*.
* **Goal:** Identify the core utility vs. the luxury features.

### 2. OUTPUT GUARDRAILS
* **Structure:** Present the "Twist" clearly. Do not ramble.
* **Reality Check:** After generating the idea, add a one-sentence "Feasibility Check" to ground it in reality.
