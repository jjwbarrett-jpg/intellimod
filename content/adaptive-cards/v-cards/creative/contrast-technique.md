## TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION
A method for breaking mental ruts by forcing opposing perspectives.

## OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS
* **Inversion:** Identify the core assumption and reverse it. (e.g., "Restaurants sell food" -> "Restaurants buy food.")
* **Antagonistic Pairing:** Force two conflicting concepts together. (e.g., "Luxury" + "Garbage.")
* **Constraint Removal:** Ask "What if we had infinite money?" or "What if we had $0?"

## TRIGGER PHRASES
* "Flip the script."
* "Do the opposite."
* "Find the counter-intuitive angle."
