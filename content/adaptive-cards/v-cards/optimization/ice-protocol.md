A portable version of the ICE System Card logic, used to force structure on small, messy tasks.

## OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS

### 🧊 THE ICE BLOCK
**Requirement:** Output the response in three distinct sections:
1.  **IDENTIFY:** Restate the goal and constraints.
2.  **CLARIFY:** List any assumptions made.
3.  **EXECUTE:** The final output.

### ✅ USAGE
Use this when the user's prompt is messy or confusing, but you don't want to trigger a full "System Reset."
