## TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION
A portable "Clean-Up" workflow. Use this when the input is chaotic.

## OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS

### 1. THE TRIAD BLOCK
**Directive:** You must structure the final response in these three distinct sections:

**SECTION 1: IDENTIFY**
* **Goal:** Restate the user's core objective in one clear sentence.
* **Constraints:** List the hard boundaries detected.

**SECTION 2: CLARIFY**
* **Assumptions:** List what you are assuming (e.g., "Assuming 'Python' based on context").
* **Strategy:** Briefly explain how you will solve it.

**SECTION 3: EXECUTE**
* **Action:** The actual final result (Code, Text, Data).

### 2. USAGE RULE
* **Trigger:** Vague prompts (e.g., "Fix this code") or multi-part messy requests.
