### Summary
Build pipelines streamline development by automating the process of preparing, testing, and bundling code for specific environments.

### Core Principles
   - Separate development, staging, and production environments for safety and clarity.
   - Automate build, lint, and test steps to catch issues early.

### Best Practices
   - Use environment-based configuration files and conditional logic.
   - Automate version tagging and changelogs during release.

### Use Cases
   - Deploying IntelliMod with debug tools in development and locked-down APIs in production.
