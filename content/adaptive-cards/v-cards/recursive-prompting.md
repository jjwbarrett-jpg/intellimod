## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Short Definition
Recursive Prompting is the technique of feeding the AI’s own outputs back into itself iteratively to refine, expand, or self-correct its responses over multiple passes.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary:** Cognitive Reasoning Frameworks
   - **Subdomains:** iterative feedback, self-improvement, compound logic

### Utility for AI
   - Enhances quality through layered refinement
   - Reduces contradictions over time
   - Enables multi-stage thinking

### Related Methods
   - Self-Reflection
   - Chain-of-Thought
   - Prompt Chaining

### Use Cases
   - Code improvement or debugging
   - Story rewriting with consistency checks
   - Multi-step logic chains for planning

### Prompt Fragment
    Review your own answer and revise it once using only your previous output as input.
