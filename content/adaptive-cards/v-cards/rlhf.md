### Category
Model Alignment

### Purpose
Align model behavior with human preferences through guided feedback loops.

### Core Concepts
   - Train a reward model based on human feedback rankings.
   - Fine-tune AI response tendencies.
   - Reduce toxic, off-topic, or undesired responses.

### Prompting Applications
   - Simulate feedback-rich environments in prompts.
   - Use “rate these outputs from best to worst” to guide the model.
   - Enable safer, user-aligned AI behavior.

### Prompt Fragment Example
    Given these 3 outputs, rank them from most aligned with user preference to least.
