## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Latent Semantics & Representation

### Core Function
Explores how an AI “understands” concepts by generating and analyzing imagined variations or uses of a term.

### Definition
Hypothetical Embedding Probes ask the AI to generate alternate versions, analogies, or edge-case uses of a concept to reveal its internal model of that concept. This technique can expose biases, uncover relationships, or fine-tune concept alignment.

### Example

**Prompt:**
“Give three alternate phrasings of the term ‘algorithm’ used in totally different fields. What connects them?”
Effect: Reveals the model’s internal associations and latent representations.

### Trigger Phrases
   - “What might this concept look like in a fantasy world?”
   - “What’s the opposite or inverse of this idea?”
   - “Give me three metaphors for this concept.”
   - “Generate three hypothetical variants and explain the link.”
