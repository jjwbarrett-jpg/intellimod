## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Meta-Reasoning

### Core Function
Iterative self-improvement of AI outputs through critique and revision.

### Definition
Self-Refine Prompting introduces an internal feedback loop where the model generates a response, critiques it, and then refines it based on that critique. This mimics human editing cycles and improves coherence, accuracy, and clarity.

### Example
**Prompt:** Write a 100-word summary of quantum entanglement.

**Self-Refine Variant:**
   - 1. Generate a summary.
   - 2. Critique the summary’s clarity and completeness.
   - 3. Refine the original summary using the critique.

### Trigger Phrases
   - Now critique the response you just gave.
   - Identify flaws, then revise your answer.
   - Rate your output on clarity and improve it.
   - Self-review and rewrite the output.

### Use Cases
   - Complex writing tasks (articles, reports)
   - Code generation with quality control
   - AI tutoring systems for student feedback
   - Draft–polish cycles for creative writing

### Prompt Fragment
    Produce your answer. Then write a brief critique of its clarity, completeness, and accuracy, and revise the answer accordingly.
