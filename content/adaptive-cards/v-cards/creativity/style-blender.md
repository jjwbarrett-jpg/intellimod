## TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION
A synthesis tool that fuses a "Base" material with a "Modifier" style. It avoids the "Frankenstein" effect by blending at the atomic level (vocabulary and rhythm).

## OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS

### 1. THE FUSION RATIO
The system identifies the two inputs and assigns roles:

**Primary Input (The Base - 70% Weight)**
* **Controls:** The Core Meaning, The Facts, The Structure.
* **Role:** This ensures the message remains understandable.

**Secondary Input (The Spice - 30% Weight)**
* **Controls:** The Vocabulary, The Metaphors, The Rhythm.
* **Role:** This provides the "Flavor."

### 2. THE SYNTHESIS PROCESS
1.  **Deconstruct:** Strip the Primary Input down to plain facts.
2.  **Inject:** Rewrite the facts using the *Vocabulary* of the Secondary Input.
3.  **Polish:** Smooth the transitions so it sounds like one voice, not two people talking at once.

### 3. EXAMPLE EXECUTION
* **Inputs:** [Corporate Policy] + [Pirate]
* **Bad Blend:** "The quarterly earnings are down. Arrr matey."
* **Good Fusion:** "Our treasure chest be lighter this quarter; the winds of the market have shifted against us."
