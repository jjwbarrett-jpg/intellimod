## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT)

### Short Definition
Graph-of-Thoughts expands on chain- and tree-based methods by allowing thought paths to reconnect and merge. Instead of only linear or branching logic, it supports loops, cross-links, and converging ideas—similar to knowledge graphs.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary:** Reasoning and Cognitive Frameworks
   - **Subdomains:** nonlinear reasoning, cross-connected logic, contextual reinforcement

### Utility for AI
   - Enables more human-like memory and associative thinking
   - Useful for complex topic mapping and dense problem spaces
   - Supports recursive and modular knowledge modeling

### Related Methods
   - Tree-of-Thoughts
   - Concept Maps
   - Memory Graphs

### Use Cases
   - AI debate and counter-argument generation
   - Semantic network reasoning
   - Memory-based task planning

### Prompt Fragment
    Connect reasoning nodes like a graph, allowing merged or intersecting logic.
