## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Cognitive Frameworks

### Purpose
Modulates how an AI reasons or thinks in response to different task types by adapting its internal strategy to fit user intent or complexity level.

### Concept
Dynamic Reasoning Profiles (DRPs) guide the model to adopt specific patterns of reasoning—such as step-by-step deduction, holistic synthesis, or lateral ideation—depending on task context. Useful in multi-domain agents, collaborative settings, or shifting prompt scopes.

### Typical Use Cases
   - Switching between rapid summarization vs. deep analysis
   - Adapting thought patterns for legal, scientific, or creative tasks
   - Aligning reasoning style with user tone or preference (e.g., “be intuitive,” “think like a detective”)

### Structural Elements
   - **Meta-directives:** “Use intuitive reasoning,” “Apply rigorous logic,” “Balance breadth and depth”
   - **Role priming:** set personas with matching cognitive approaches
   - **Prompt paths:** use preconditionals like “If X complexity, then reason via Y style”
   - **Profile labeling:** e.g., reasoning_profile="Empathic-Strategic" or reasoning_mode="Technical-Stepwise"

### Sample Invocation
    "Use a deductive approach with cautious assumptions. Present your answer as if advising a high-stakes mission planner."

### Benefits
   - Encourages self-modulation of reasoning depth
   - Reduces overthinking for simple tasks and over-simplification for complex ones
   - Supports adaptive systems and long-form interactions
