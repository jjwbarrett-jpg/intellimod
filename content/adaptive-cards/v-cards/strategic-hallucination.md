## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Creativity & Ideation

### Core Function
Intentionally prompts the AI to generate fictional or speculative content to inspire creativity, brainstorm options, or simulate ideas.

### Definition
Instead of avoiding hallucination, this technique guides the model to produce imaginative or unreal scenarios in a controlled context (e.g., alt-history, speculative tech, story prototyping). Output is framed as fictional on purpose.

### Example

**Prompt:**
Imagine a world where gravity reverses every 12 hours. What new technologies or behaviors would exist?

### Trigger Phrases
   - Invent a fictional version of...
   - Speculate based on a false premise...
   - Imagine if this impossible thing were true...
   - Give 3 creative hallucinations based on the seed idea.
