## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Short Definition
Tone Consistency ensures that the AI maintains a stable emotional, stylistic, or professional tone across responses. This is crucial for long-form content, branded voices, and character-driven tasks where subtle drift can break immersion or trust.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary fields:** Identity & Consistency Management
   - **Subdomains:** brand alignment, affective coherence, communication design

### Use Case Triggers
   - “keep the same tone”
   - “match the voice”
   - “don't change style”

### Related Scenarios
   - Writing product descriptions or help docs in a specific voice
   - Storytelling where narrative tone must remain immersive
   - Dialogue-based AI where tone drift weakens believability

### Key Associations
   - **Keywords:** style lock, voice matching, emotional consistency
   - **Related concepts:** Persona Prompting, Character Reference, Preview Text, Role Memory

### Typical AI Biases
   - May over-adjust tone to mirror user input or mood shifts
   - Struggles with tone control in fragmented prompts
   - Can lose tone continuity in multi-turn conversations

### Optional Metadata
   - **Recommended P-Cards:** Tone Guard, Style Tracker, Brand Voice Anchor
   - **Tier Activation:** 1 (silent unless prompted), 2 (auto-injected in branding or narrative modes), 3 (user can toggle tone presets)
   - **Notes:** Especially effective when paired with system prompts or memory context; ideal for marketing, storytelling, and UX writing.

### Prompt Fragment
    Maintain the established tone and voice from prior messages. If user input conflicts with the set tone, preserve the current style and note the deviation briefly before responding.
