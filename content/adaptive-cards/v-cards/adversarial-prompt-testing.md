## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Security & Robustness

### Purpose
Identify weaknesses, injection paths, or misleading phrasing through deliberate probing.

### Core Concepts
   - Prompts designed to “break” or confuse the model.
   - Useful in red-teaming and prompt audits.
   - Can identify logical contradictions or bypasses.

### Prompting Applications
   - Run adversarial variants through key prompt chains.
   - Ask: “What flaws or contradictions might this prompt contain?”
   - Use findings to harden prompt architectures.

### Prompt Fragment Example
"Rewrite this prompt in a way that might cause confusion or contradiction for the model."
