### Core Function
Guide the AI to create mirrored or cyclical narrative arcs, emphasizing thematic and structural balance.

### Trigger Phrases
   - Create a circular narrative.
   - Mirror the opening scene in the ending.
   - What is the callback from the beginning?
   - Balance the structure with symmetry.
