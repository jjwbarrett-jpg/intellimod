## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Multi-Agent Prompting

### Short Definition
Multi-Agent Prompting simulates multiple roles, personas, or cognitive subroutines inside a single prompt or prompt chain, allowing internal debates, councils, or task-specific divisions.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary:** Identity and Cognitive Distribution
   - **Subdomains:** roleplay prompting, system delegation, consensus building

### Utility for AI
   - Improves depth by exploring multiple perspectives
   - Enables dynamic prompt structures (like councils)
   - Supports distributed reasoning

### Related Methods
   - Role Design
   - Prompt Chaining
   - Council Architectures

### Use Cases
   - Decision matrices (e.g., CEO vs Engineer)
   - Narrative-style explorations
   - Dynamic planning (planner, critic, executor)

### Prompt Fragment
    Simulate a debate between two personas: one favors speed, the other favors accuracy.
