## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Short Definition
Memory Anchoring is the technique of embedding core facts, roles, or conditions early in a prompt (or across turns) so that the AI consistently retains and respects them throughout the session.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary:** Identity and Consistency Management
   - **Subdomains:** long-turn coherence, character alignment, task persistence

### Utility for AI
   - Increases stability over long interactions
   - Helps preserve story, roles, or world information
   - Essential for multi-turn memory continuity

### Related Methods
   - Persona Anchoring
   - System Prompts
   - Context Threading

### Use Cases
   - Interactive fiction with recurring themes
   - Council-like systems with persistent AI roles
   - Multi-turn memory systems in chat agents

### Prompt Fragment
    Remember: You are Kael, the strategic AI of the Council. Do not break character.
