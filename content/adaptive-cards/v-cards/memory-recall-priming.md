## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Context Recovery and Continuity

### Purpose
Trigger recall of relevant prior information, conversations, or system instructions that may otherwise be inaccessible.

### Core Concepts
   - Useful in long-term interactions or simulated memory systems.
   - Helps AI maintain thread continuity across disconnected sessions.
   - Often paired with pre-prompts, labels, or identifiers.

### Prompting Applications
   - “Refer back to the knowledge you had about [X].”
   - “Recall the last strategy we used for this type of prompt.”

### Prompt Fragment Example
    Prime your memory of our earlier work on multi-agent setups — especially the section on task arbitration.
