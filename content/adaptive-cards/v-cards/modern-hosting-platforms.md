### Summary
Modern hosting platforms offer a range of solutions from simple prototyping environments to production-grade cloud infrastructure for static sites and full-stack applications.

### Core Principles
   - Select a platform based on the project’s needs: Replit for prototyping, GitHub Pages for static sites, and Netlify or Vercel for production apps.
   - A poly-platform strategy can leverage multiple hosting services across a product ecosystem for performance and cost efficiency.

### Best Practices
   - Use Replit for rapid prototyping and collaboration without local setup.
   - Use GitHub Pages for version-controlled static site deployment.

### Use Cases
   - Choosing hosting based on stage (ideation → launch) across a toolchain.
