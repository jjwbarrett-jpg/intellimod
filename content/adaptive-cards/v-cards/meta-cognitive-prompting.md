## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Self-Monitoring & Reflection

### Purpose
Encourage the AI to reflect on its own reasoning, assumptions, or approach before or after generating a response.

### Core Concepts
   - Adds a deliberate analysis layer to improve quality and reduce hallucination.
   - Can occur before (preflight check) or after (postflight audit) the main response.
   - Simulates internal dialogue or quality control.

### Prompting Applications
   - Before answering, consider whether your initial assumption is valid.
   - After completing your response, reflect on any areas of uncertainty.
   - Useful for step-by-step reasoning or high-stakes content.

### Prompt Fragment Example
    After giving your response, analyze your reasoning for gaps, contradictions, or uncertainty.
