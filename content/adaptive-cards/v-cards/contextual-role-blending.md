Contextual Role Blending

### Summary
Contextual Role Blending is the practice of dynamically merging multiple prompt roles, system instructions, or character styles into a single cohesive voice or function. This allows the AI to adapt between instructional, narrative, or advisory tones while maintaining internal coherence. It is useful for complex, multi-phase workflows or hybrid character-agent systems.

### Core Functionality
   - Enables merging of system roles (e.g., assistant plus teacher).
   - Maintains a consistent voice across shifting task boundaries.
   - Reduces fragmentation when handling nested prompts or split-author prompts.

### Applications
   - Complex agent simulations (e.g., a doctor who is also a motivational coach).
   - Instruction plus evaluation prompts in educational settings.
   - Narrative agents switching between characters and narrators.

### Benefits
   - Enhances flexibility in hybrid prompt design.
   - Reduces the need for hard resets or restating roles.
   - Improves user immersion in character-rich or multi-purpose interfaces.

### Risks and Limitations
   - Risk of voice drift or conflicting tone if roles are incompatible.
   - May dilute clarity of function if not grounded in clear framing.
   - Can confuse users if role identity is ambiguous without context cues.

### Integration Tips
   - Anchor each blended role with a consistent core tone or narrative voice.
   - Use delimiter markers (---, ***, etc.) for phase switching if clarity is needed.
   - Reinforce priority of function (e.g., "You are primarily a mentor, secondarily a tactician").
