## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Logical Precision

### Core Function
Offloads logical or mathematical steps into generated code snippets that are executed externally for accurate results.

### Definition
Chain-of-Code prompting instructs the AI to reason by writing code (e.g., Python) that solves sub-tasks instead of explaining them in plain language. The generated code is then executed to yield accurate, deterministic results—especially for math, logic, or data tasks.

### Example

**Prompt:**
"Use Python to calculate how many apples John has if he started with 5, bought 3 more, and gave away 2. Show code, then result."

### Trigger Phrases
   - "Write code to solve this step."
   - "Generate Python to answer the question."
   - "Use a script instead of natural language reasoning."
   - "Insert a code block to complete the logic."

### Related Concepts
   - Program of Thoughts
   - Self-Consistency
   - External Tool Integration
   - Dynamic Reasoning Profiles

### Use Cases
   - Math-heavy or data science tasks
   - Financial analysis
   - Logic puzzles or code tutoring
   - Any domain where precision overrides language ambiguity
