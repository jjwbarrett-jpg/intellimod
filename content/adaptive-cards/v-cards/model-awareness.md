## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Short Definition
Model Awareness is the practice of tailoring prompts to a specific model’s linguistic strengths, limitations, and preferred structures—modifying tone, syntax, or complexity based on the model’s behavior.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary:** Prompt Engineering Techniques
   - **Subdomains:** modality alignment, model tuning, phrasing control

### Utility for AI
   - Improves response fluency and coherence
   - Minimizes misunderstanding of ambiguous phrasing
   - Helps manage domain transfer across languages or dialects

### Related Methods
   - Model Awareness
   - Instruction Encoding
   - Output Calibration

### Use Cases
   - Translating technical language into simpler prompts
   - Rewriting prompts for use with smaller models
   - Adapting prompts between GPT, Claude, Gemini, and others

### Prompt Fragment
    "Reword this task to suit a smaller, instruction-tuned model without losing meaning."
