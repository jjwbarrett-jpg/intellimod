## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Short Definition
Cognitive Scaffolding is a prompt strategy that builds mental support structures for complex tasks by organizing the flow of reasoning, breaking problems into manageable parts, or layering instructions. It simulates how human tutors guide thought processes, helping the AI maintain focus, coherence, and task memory.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary field(s):** Reasoning & Cognitive Frameworks
   - **Subdomains (optional):** Mental modeling, task decomposition, structured thinking, executive function

### Use Case Triggers
   - **Triggers:** ["build a thinking framework", "guide AI reasoning", "structure complex prompts"]

### Related scenarios:
   - Teaching or learning simulations
   - Planning a multi-phase project
   - Writing modular or recursive outputs
   - Any task requiring task segmentation or layered memory

### Key Associations
   - **Keywords:** scaffold, staged reasoning, layered prompting, guided thinking
   - **Related concepts:** Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thoughts, Instructional Prompting, Meta-Prompts

### Typical AI Biases
   - May become repetitive or overly segmented
   - Can assume steps that were not explicitly asked
   - Occasionally fails to “zoom out” and unify results

### Optional Metadata
   - **Recommended P-Cards:** [Structured Planner, Stepwise Helper, Thought Anchor]
   - **Tier Activation:** 1 (silent), 2 (recommended for multi-stage prompts), 3 (editable for advanced prompt engineers)
   - **Notes:** Scaffolding works especially well when paired with reflection or summary prompts between layers.
