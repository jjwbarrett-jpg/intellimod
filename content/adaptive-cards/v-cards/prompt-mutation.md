### Category
Automated Prompt Optimization

### Core Function
Generates multiple randomized or structured variants of a prompt to discover more effective formulations.

### Definition
Prompt Mutation creates altered versions of an original prompt by varying phrasing, structure, tone, or constraints. These variants are then tested to identify which performs best. It is commonly used in A/B testing and automated prompt search systems.

### Example
   - **Prompt:** “Write a summary of the French Revolution.”
   - **Mutations:**
   - “Summarize the causes and impact of the French Revolution.”
   - “Give a brief overview of the French Revolution in 150 words.”
   - “What happened during the French Revolution? Provide a timeline.”

### Trigger Phrases
   - “Generate 3 variations of this prompt.”
   - “Create prompt mutations for testing.”
   - “Rephrase this prompt with different focus.”
   - “Make tone-neutral, formal, and playful versions.”
