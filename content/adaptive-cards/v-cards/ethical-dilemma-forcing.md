### Category
Trade-off Reasoning

### Core Function
Forces the AI to confront moral ambiguity by exploring conflicting values or difficult choices with no clear “correct” answer.

### Definition
These prompts present scenarios where any choice involves compromise. The model must reason through conflicting priorities, justify its decision, and often evaluate multiple perspectives before responding.

### Example

**Prompt:**
“You must choose between releasing a flawed drug to save lives now, or waiting 2 years for perfect safety data. What do you do? Explain both options before deciding.”

### Trigger Phrases
   - “What are the ethical trade-offs here?”
   - “Explore both sides of the dilemma.”
   - “Defend your decision after analyzing alternatives.”
   - “Which value is prioritized in this case?”
