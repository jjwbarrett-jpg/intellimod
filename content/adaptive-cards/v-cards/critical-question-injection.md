### Category
Adversarial Prompt Testing

### Core Function
Injects challenge questions or counterpoints into prompts to improve reasoning, robustness, or truthfulness.

### Definition
This technique introduces sharp or skeptical questions during generation, forcing the model to confront blind spots, defend its claims, or improve logic. It mimics critical thinking and is often used to detect hallucinations or surface deeper insights.

### Example

**Prompt:**
   - "Summarize the benefits of social media."
   **Injected Challenge:**
   - "Now answer: What are the strongest criticisms of these benefits?"

### Trigger Phrases
   - "What would a critic say?"
   - "Challenge the assumptions in your answer."
   - "Add 2 counterpoints or risks to your response."
   - "Ask a tough follow-up question and respond to it."
