## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Short Definition
A Visual Logic Scaffold is a structured visual prompt layout (e.g., diagrams, tables, spatial anchors) used to guide AI through reasoning steps or organizational structure during multimodal tasks.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary:** Multimodal Prompting
   - **Subdomains:** visual reasoning, cognitive scaffolding, diagrammatic logic

### Utility for AI
   - Helps structure AI reasoning in visual formats
   - Encourages multi-phase logic workflows
   - Enhances cross-modal comprehension

### Related Methods
   - Chain-of-Thought
   - Cognitive Scaffolding
   - Visual Prompt Engineering

### Use Cases
   - Building flowcharts from text logic
   - Translating graphs into explanations
   - Cross-domain planning tools

### Prompt Fragment
    Organize the steps in a grid: Column A = action, Column B = justification.
