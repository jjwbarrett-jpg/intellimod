## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Definition
Counterfactual Prompting explores “what-if” scenarios to improve reasoning, generate alternative perspectives, or stress-test assumptions. It leverages hypothetical or reversed conditions to simulate different outcomes or explore the bounds of knowledge.

### Core Uses
   - Scenario exploration for strategic planning, ethics, or risk modeling.
   - Hypothetical simulations for creative writing, philosophical reasoning, or decision branching.
   - Testing robustness of AI responses by altering assumptions.

### Format Template
   - "What if [X condition were different]?"
   - "Imagine [reversed situation]. How would that affect [Y]?"

### Notes
Counterfactuals can enhance creativity, support training in moral or ethical debates, and push the model into novel idea spaces. Useful in legal, scientific, and narrative contexts.
