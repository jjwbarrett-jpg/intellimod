### Category
Prompt Optimization Workflows

### Core Function
Chain several mutated prompts into a sequence, filtering outputs to find the most effective or aligned result.

### Definition
Prompt Mutation Chains generate a series of prompt variations (mutations), execute them, then evaluate and select the best-performing output using predefined filters or criteria (manual or automated). This extends Prompt Mutation into a scalable optimization loop.

### Example
   - Generate 5 mutations of a prompt.
   - Evaluate each based on clarity, length, and tone.
   - Select the best and refine it further.
   - Use the final result in a downstream chain or store it.

### Trigger Phrases
   - Chain 3 variations and compare outputs.
   - Mutate, evaluate, refine, finalize.
   - Run prompt optimization chain.
   - Select top output based on clarity and tone.
