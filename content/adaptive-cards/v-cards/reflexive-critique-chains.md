## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Meta-Review Systems

### Core Function
Runs self-critique loops recursively across multiple prompt generations to refine output through evolving internal feedback.

### Definition
The model critiques its own previous answer, revises it, critiques the revision, and repeats. This creates a loop of introspective refinement useful when maximum clarity or correctness is required.

### Example

**Prompt:** Write a summary of AI safety. Then critique it. Revise it. Now critique that revision. Stop after 2 cycles.

### Trigger Phrases
   - Critique your revision of the last version.
   - Repeat feedback and improvement for two rounds.
   - Refine the output recursively.
   - Rate and revise iteratively.
