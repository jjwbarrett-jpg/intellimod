## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Short Definition
Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) is a reasoning technique where the AI explores multiple thought branches in parallel, forming a tree-like structure of possible paths. It enables backtracking, comparing alternatives, and choosing optimal routes by scoring or evaluating different paths.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary:** Reasoning & Cognitive Frameworks
   - **Subdomains:** parallel exploration, divergent reasoning, outcome evaluation

### Utility for AI
   - Enhances multi-step decision-making
   - Avoids tunnel vision by evaluating multiple continuations
   - Enables recursive refinement or pruning

### Related Methods
   - Chain-of-Thought
   - Self-Refine
   - Graph-of-Thoughts

### Use Cases
   - Complex planning
   - Creative problem solving
   - Narrative generation with multiple plot branches

### Prompt Fragment
Explore multiple reasoning paths before selecting the best one.
