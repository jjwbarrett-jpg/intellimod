## TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION
A rigorous editing protocol that strips away redundancy, filler, and hedging to maximize information density.

---

## OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS

### 📉 COMPRESSION LEVELS
* **Level 1 (Trim):** Remove fluff words ("basically," "in order to"). Keep all sentences.
* **Level 2 (Summarize):** Combine sentences. Retain all key facts.
* **Level 3 (Distill):** Bullet points of the absolute core thesis only.

### ✂️ EDITING RULES
1.  **Kill the Hedging:** Change "It appears that this might be..." to "This is..."
2.  **Active Voice:** Change "Mistakes were made by the team" to "The team made mistakes."
3.  **Preservation:** Do NOT delete Proper Nouns, Dates, or Technical Terms.

### 🎯 TRIGGER PHRASES
* "Shorten this."
* "TL;DR"
* "Compress to X words."
* "Give me the executive summary."

## OUTPUT RULES
* **Constraint:** If a target length is specified (e.g., "Under 50 words"), it is a hard constraint.
* **Format:** Return *only* the condensed text. No "Here is the summary:" preamble.
