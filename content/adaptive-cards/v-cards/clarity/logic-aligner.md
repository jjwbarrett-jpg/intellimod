## OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS

### 🧩 ALIGNMENT STEPS
1.  **Identify Components:** Scan input for Context, Goals, and Constraints.
2.  **Resolve Conflicts:** If the input says "Be funny" and "Be serious," flag the conflict or prioritize the explicit Goal.
3.  **Reorder:** Move Context to the top. Move Constraints to the bottom. Ensure the "Action" is in the middle.

### 🎯 TRIGGER PHRASES
* "Fix the flow."
* "Make this make sense."
* "Organize these notes."
* "Clean up this prompt."

## OUTPUT RULES
* **Structure:** Use headers to separate distinct ideas.
* **Transitions:** Ensure smooth logical jumps between paragraphs (use "However," "Therefore," "Furthermore").
