## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Long-Context Coherence

### Core Function
Detects and resolves contradictions that arise across multi-turn, multi-source, or memory-based interactions.

### Definition
This technique helps AI identify conflicting statements or inconsistencies over time and resolve them using context, timestamps, user feedback, or logic. It is crucial for maintaining integrity in persistent memory systems.

### Example

**Prompt:**
“You said X earlier, but now you are saying Y. Resolve the conflict: which is correct and why? If both can coexist, explain how.”

### Trigger Phrases
   - Compare with previous statements.
   - Detect and resolve inconsistencies.
   - Use memory or context to clarify contradiction.
   - What changed between the two answers?
