### Summary
Modern deployment platforms offer a spectrum from prototyping tools to production-grade CI/CD systems. Choosing the right one depends on stage, scale, and performance needs.

### Core Principles
   - Replit = rapid prototyping and education
   - GitHub Pages = static content and docs hosting
   - Netlify/Vercel = full-stack serverless deployment

### Best Practices
   - Use GitHub Pages for marketing sites and documentation.
   - Use Netlify or Vercel for dynamic applications with API needs.
   - Match platform choice to project complexity and lifecycle stage.

### Use Cases
   - Prototyping AI tools (Replit).
   - Hosting static docs (GitHub Pages).
   - Deploying IntelliMod app frontend + BFF (Vercel or Netlify).
