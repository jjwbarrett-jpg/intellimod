## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Short Definition
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a prompting technique that encourages the AI to reason through problems step by step. Instead of jumping to conclusions, it simulates a logical thought process, often leading to more accurate and explainable results—especially in complex tasks like math, logic, and planning.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary field(s):** Reasoning & Cognitive Frameworks
   - **Subdomains (optional):** Stepwise reasoning, task decomposition, transparent logic chains

### Use Case Triggers
**Triggers:** ["chain-of-thought reasoning", "step-by-step solution", "solve this problem carefully"]

### Related scenarios:
   - Multi-step math problems
   - Logical deduction (puzzles, riddles)
   - Explaining abstract concepts or workflows

### Key Associations
   - **Keywords:** CoT, reasoning chain, stepwise logic, logical progression
   - **Related concepts:** Tree-of-Thoughts, Self-Consistency, Chain-of-Verification, ReAct

### Typical AI Biases
   - Can hallucinate plausible-sounding steps
   - May over-explain when brevity is desired
   - Sometimes lacks error-checking at each step

### Optional Metadata
   - **Recommended P-Cards:** [ICE, Self-Refine, Explanation Enhancer]
   - **Tier Activation:** 1 (silent), 2 (suggested in complex reasoning tasks), 3 (editable for advanced users)
   - **Notes:** CoT benefits greatly from few-shot examples that demonstrate reasoning format.
