## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Short Definition
Persona Prompting involves crafting and assigning a consistent character, role, or identity to the AI for the duration of a task. This anchors tone, voice, behavior, and domain expertise, making responses more coherent and aligned.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary fields:** Identity and Consistency Management
   - **Subdomains:** role simulation, voice consistency, user experience design

### Use Case Triggers
   - **Triggers:** “act as”, “respond as if you were”, “speak like”, “in character as”

### Related Scenarios
   - Building role-based AI agents (therapist, coach, historian)
   - Maintaining tone and behavior across long sessions
   - Embodying fictional characters or real-world personas

### Key Associations
   - **Keywords:** role prompting, identity scaffolding, simulated personality
   - **Related concepts:** System Prompt, Role Design, Voice Personas, Style Matching

### Typical AI Biases
   - May default to stereotypes or exaggerated behavior
   - Risk of persona leakage between roles
   - Can prioritize character tone over task accuracy if not constrained

### Optional Metadata
   - **Recommended P-Cards:** Role Matrix, Tone Stabilizer, Character Consistency Engine
   - **Tier Activation:** 1 (silent fallback), 2 (auto-suggested for longform dialogue), 3 (user-editable profiles)
   - **Notes:** Works best when roles are clearly defined and paired with consistent system instructions. Useful for multi-agent simulation or branded assistants.
