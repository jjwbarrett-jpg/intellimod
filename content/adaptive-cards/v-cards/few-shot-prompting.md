## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Short Definition
Few-Shot Prompting provides the AI with a small number of examples (typically 2–5) to help it infer the desired output style, format, or logic. It improves generalization in ambiguous tasks by anchoring the model to known patterns, offering a balance between flexibility and control.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary fields:** Prompt Engineering Techniques
   - **Subdomains (optional):** example-based prompting, transfer learning, low-data conditioning

### Use Case Triggers
   - **Triggers:** “give 3 examples”, “use a few examples”, “demonstrate with samples”

### Related Scenarios
   - Classification, labeling, or formatting tasks
   - Teaching AI new styles or rules on the fly
   - Simulating user-specific tones, formats, or expectations

### Key Associations
   - **Keywords:** example-based prompting, sample anchoring, in-context learning
   - **Related concepts:** Zero-Shot Prompting, One-Shot Prompting, Pattern Completion, Role Prompting

### Typical AI Biases
   - Can become overly sensitive to subtle differences between examples
   - Risk of overfitting to unrepresentative samples
   - May ignore instructions in favor of imitating the examples

### Optional Metadata
   - **Recommended P-Cards:** Pattern Loader, Format Guide, Mimic Logic
   - **Tier Activation:** 1 (passive), 2 (auto-suggested when ambiguity is high), 3 (manual override for advanced formatting)
   - **Notes:** Great for crafting adaptive templates or testing instruction-following behavior in unusual tasks.
