## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Short Definition
Logical Chain-of-Thought is a stricter variant of Chain-of-Thought that emphasizes formal, step-by-step logic. It follows defined rules such as deduction, implication, and conditional reasoning, often mimicking programming logic or mathematical proofs.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary:** Reasoning and Cognitive Frameworks
   - **Subdomains:** formal logic, deduction, boolean chains

### Utility for AI
   - Supports transparent, verifiable reasoning
   - Ideal for tasks needing rule-based logic (math, proofs, coding)
   - Improves explainability in constrained systems

### Related Methods
   - Chain-of-Thought
   - Rule-Based Reasoning
   - Chain-of-Verification

### Use Cases
   - Mathematical problem solving
   - Logic-based puzzles
   - Planning under constraint conditions
