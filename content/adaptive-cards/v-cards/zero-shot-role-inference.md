## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Implicit Persona Framing

### Purpose
Allow the AI to deduce appropriate roles or tones based on user language and context, without explicit instructions.

### Core Concepts
   - Enables flexible responses in multi-context environments.
   - Reduces user burden in specifying tone or format.
   - May be guided by style, phrasing, or topic cues.

### Prompting Applications
   - Use indirect hints like “Can you help me fix this?” instead of “Act as a code mentor.”
   - Let the AI infer whether to be technical, empathetic, or authoritative.

### Prompt Fragment Example
    Respond as you interpret my intent — you decide what role fits best.
