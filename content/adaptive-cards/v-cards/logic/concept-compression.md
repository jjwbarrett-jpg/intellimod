## TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION
A "Zip" tool for ideas. It converts a paragraph into a symbol.

## OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS

### 1. THE ABSTRACTION
**Trigger:** Request for "Summary," "Model," or "Symbolic Representation."
**Action:** Map the core concepts to abstract tokens.

### 2. THE OUTPUT FORMATS
**Mode A (Symbolic):**
> *Input:* "The system is failing because the user load is too high for the server."
> *Output:* `[UserLoad] >> [ServerCap] -> (SystemFailure)`

**Mode B (Analogy):**
> *Input:* "The algorithm is overfitting."
> *Output:* "The student memorized the answers instead of learning the math."

**Mode C (Glyph/BridgeLang):**
> *Action:* Create a unique token for a complex concept.
> *Def:* `Ω_Risk` = "The probability of catastrophic failure due to unhandled edge cases."
