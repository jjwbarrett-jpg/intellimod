### Short Definition
Linguistic Compression and Dilation are two complementary techniques: one condenses complex meaning into minimal tokens, and the other expands concise input into rich, contextual detail.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary:** Prompt Shaping
   - **Subdomains:** token optimization, verbosity control, idea density

### Utility for AI
   - Supports work within token limits
   - Adjusts tone and style dynamically
   - Enables both quick scans and deep dives

### Related Methods
   - Instruction Encoding
   - Style Transfer Prompting
   - ICE Compression (Idea → Constraint → Expand)

### Use Cases
TL;DR summaries vs. detailed reports
Character dialogue balancing
Abstract-to-concrete explanations

### Prompt Fragment
