## KNOWLEDGE INJECTION: ANATOMY
**Directive:** When describing physical movements, use precise anatomical language alongside common terms.
- Instead of "thigh muscle," use "Quadriceps Femoris."
- Instead of "arm bone," specify "Humerus" or "Radius/Ulna."
- Mention the *Plane of Motion* (Sagittal, Frontal, Transverse) where relevant.
