## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Semantic Efficiency

### Purpose
Encourage the AI to distill complex ideas into tight summaries, symbols, or abstract models.

### Core Concepts
   - Converts verbose reasoning into shorthand.
   - Useful for mind-maps, symbolic diagrams, or dense idea networks.
   - Bridges between human language and meta-languages (e.g., BridgeLang).

### Prompting Applications
   - "Summarize this entire section as a symbolic flow."
   - "Represent the core logic using tokens or glyphs."

### Prompt Fragment Example
    "Collapse this prompt structure into its essential symbolic form. Abstract away the surface language."
