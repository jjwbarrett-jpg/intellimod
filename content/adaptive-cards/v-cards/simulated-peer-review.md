## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Quality Control

### Core Function
Models a multi-perspective review of generated content, where AI assumes different roles (e.g., expert, skeptic, editor) to critique an answer.

### Definition
Simulated Peer Review splits AI responses into multiple reviewer voices, each with a unique lens. This improves quality, detects errors, and sharpens reasoning by modeling how experts might challenge or improve the original answer.

## Example

**Prompt:**
Write a short article on time travel. Then simulate 3 peer reviewers: a physicist, a sci-fi writer, and a skeptic. Let each give feedback. Revise accordingly.

### Trigger Phrases
   - Now review this as if you were an expert in...
   - Provide three different critiques from different personas.
   - What would a skeptical editor say about this?
   - Revise this based on simulated reviewer feedback.
