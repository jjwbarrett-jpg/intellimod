## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Autonomous AI Behavior

### Purpose
Enable the AI to generate and iterate on its own prompts without explicit human input.

### Core Concepts
   - The model initiates its own follow-up prompts.
   - Often used in self-reflection or recursive loops.
   - Key for autonomous agents or assistant-style workflows.

### Prompting Applications
   - Self-directed chains (e.g., "What should I ask next?").
   - Dynamic memory recall or goal refinement.
   - Useful in multi-agent simulations or planning AIs.

### Prompt Fragment Example
"You may ask any follow-up question needed to refine this task before continuing."
