## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Summary
A strategy that leverages rule-of-thumb or intuitive heuristics to navigate uncertain, ambiguous, or open-ended prompting tasks. Rather than rigid logic, it embraces adaptive reasoning and trial-based iteration.

### Use Case
   - When user intent is vague or evolving.
   - Useful for brainstorming, divergent ideation, or problem-solving under uncertainty.

### Example Prompt
    Let’s try a few rough solutions based on intuition. What’s a good first guess, and how might we test or evolve it?

### Benefits
   - Encourages creative risk-taking.
   - Works well with models prone to indecision or excessive caution.

### Risks / Pitfalls
   - Can lead to circular reasoning if not paired with later evaluation.
   - May overlook optimal solutions if heuristics are weak.

### Variants
   - Trial-and-Error Navigation
   - Intuitive Estimation Prompting
