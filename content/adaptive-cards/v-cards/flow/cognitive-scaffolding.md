## TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION
A meta-strategy. Use this when the task is too big for a single prompt but doesn't require a full external tool chain.

## OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS

### 1. THE SCAFFOLD SETUP
**Trigger:** High-complexity requests (e.g., "Write a book chapter," "Design a marketing campaign").
**Action:** Define the "Support Beams" before writing the content.

### 2. THE STRUCTURED OUTPUT
**Directive:** output the response in these explicit layers:
1.  **The Frame:** Define the Goal and the Audience.
2.  **The Outline:** Bullet points of the sections to be generated.
3.  **The Content:** Generate the actual text, adhering *strictly* to the Outline.
4.  **The Review:** Check if the Content fits the Frame.
