### Category
Prompt Transformation

### Core Function
Modifies, refines, or upgrades user prompts before execution based on higher-order logic or best practices.

### Definition
This technique intercepts and rewrites user prompts with enhanced clarity, structure, or formatting. Often used in expert agents, UI assistants, or LLM compilers, it aligns vague or suboptimal input with optimal prompting standards before model execution.

### Example

**Original Prompt:** “Help me write about AI.”

**Rewritten Meta-Prompt:** “Write a 500-word explainer on how generative AI models like ChatGPT work, for a high school audience. Use a friendly tone.”

### Trigger Phrases
   - “Rewrite this as a clear instruction.”
   - “Upgrade this prompt using best practices.”
   - “Apply CRAFT logic to reformat this prompt.”
   - “Polish and prepare this prompt for execution.”
