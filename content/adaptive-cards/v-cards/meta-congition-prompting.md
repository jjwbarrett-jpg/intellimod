### Category
Reflective Reasoning

### Purpose
Encourage the AI to assess its own reasoning or evaluate confidence in responses.

### Core Concepts
   - Promotes awareness of uncertainty or gaps.
   - Often used in multi-step reasoning or high-stakes responses.
   - Can prevent hallucinations by inviting self-checks.

### Prompting Applications
   - Ask the model to reflect on answer validity.
   - Insert confidence-ranking steps in chains.
   - Encourage critical evaluation and response refinement.

### Prompt Fragment Example
    "How confident are you in this response? If not certain, what areas might need verification?"
