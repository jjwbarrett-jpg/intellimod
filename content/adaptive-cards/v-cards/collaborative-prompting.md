## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Multi-Turn Reasoning

### Core Function
Structures a conversation where the user and AI co-create an output step-by-step, simulating a shared brainstorming or editing session.

### Definition
Collaborative Prompting treats the AI as a thinking partner rather than a one-shot tool. It breaks a task into phases—brainstorm, decide, generate, refine—each guided by active user feedback. The focus is on iteration, not perfection in a single reply.

### Example
   - **Phase 1:** "List 3 themes for a sci-fi story."
    User Feedback: "Let's go with #2."
   - **Phase 2:** "Expand that theme into a short pitch."
   - **Final:** "Now turn that into a 300-word story intro."

### Trigger Phrases
   - "Let's brainstorm this together."
   - "I'll give feedback after each step."
   - "Only complete phase 1 of the task."
   - "Pause and check with me before proceeding."
