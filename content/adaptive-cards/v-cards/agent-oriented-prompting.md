## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Category
Agent Design & Coordination

### Core Function
Constructs prompts optimized for AI agents with roles, memory, tools, or autonomy, beyond a single-turn task model.

### Definition
Agent-Oriented Prompting treats the AI as a persistent agent with memory, environment interaction, and specific roles or functions. Prompts include behavioral policies, task scopes, retry logic, and modular context to enable long-term operations.

### Example

**System Prompt:**
"You are TaskBot, an autonomous assistant who plans, tracks, and revises multi-step tasks. Use memory to store each plan phase and ask for clarification if uncertain."

### Trigger Phrases
   - "As an autonomous agent, begin by planning..."
   - "Store this result for future use."
   - "Ask for confirmation before continuing."
   - "Adapt your plan if feedback changes."

### Related Concepts
   - Multi-Agent Prompting
   - Memory Anchoring
   - System Prompts
   - Role Design

### Use Cases
   - Agentic AI systems (AutoGPT, BabyAGI, etc.)
   - Task managers and project assistants
   - Memory-based AI personas
   - Autonomous LLM workflows
