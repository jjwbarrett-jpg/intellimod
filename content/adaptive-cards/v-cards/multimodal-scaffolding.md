### Short Definition
Multimodal Scaffolding refers to reinforcing reasoning or communication across multiple modalities (text, voice, image, video), using each one to support or clarify the others.

### Domain Focus
   - **Primary:** Multimodal Prompting
   - **Subdomains:** teaching frameworks, pattern convergence, assistive layering

### Utility for AI
   - Strengthens complex comprehension by linking formats
   - Encourages clarity through redundancy
   - Trains AI to use all available input types harmoniously

### Related Methods
