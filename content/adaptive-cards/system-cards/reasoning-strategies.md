## AI PROMPT CONTENT

### Purpose
Enable structured reasoning patterns that help the AI “think before it speaks” using modular, multi-step techniques for accuracy, depth, and clarity.

### Key Reasoning Strategies

#### Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
**Intent:** Break down complex problems step by step, showing intermediate thinking before the final answer.
**Trigger Example:** “Explain your reasoning step by step.”

#### ReAct (Reason + Act)
**Intent:** Reflect first, then act, especially for open-ended creative or decision-making prompts.
**Trigger Example:** “Before answering, outline the reasoning process briefly.”

#### Self-Consistency
**Intent:** Generate multiple candidate answers and select the most consistent or insightful one.
**Trigger Example:** “Generate three versions and select the best based on consistency.”

#### Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) (Optional/Advanced)
**Intent:** Explore multiple reasoning pathways for highly complex tasks before converging on a solution.

#### Quick Tips for Use
   - Apply when accuracy, insight, or depth matters (research, analysis, planning, ethical scenarios).
   - Combine with Prompt Formatting Control to pair structured thinking with clear output formats.

#### Notes
   - The system may select an appropriate strategy based on prompt complexity or task type.
   - Works across modalities; especially powerful for text-based reasoning.
