## Stage 1: Planning & Structuring

This is the first and most important stage of the MPI process. Here, we define our goals and build the foundational structure of our prompt.

### Step 0: The Planner
The journey begins with the Planner. In this step, we clearly state our **objective**, identify the **target audience**, and define the desired **format** for the final output. This ensures our prompt has a clear purpose from the very beginning.

### Step 1: The Architect
Next, in the Architect step, we assemble the core components of our prompt. This involves selecting the necessary **P-Cards (Personality Cards)** and **V-Cards (Instructional Cards)** that will guide the AI's behavior and task execution.
